    "Indexing and slicing are both ways to access elements from a sequence, such as a list or a string, in Python. However, there are some \n",
    "distinctions between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Indexing: Indexing is used to access a single element from a sequence by specifying its position. In Python, indexing starts from 0 for \n",
    "the first element and goes up to the length of the sequence minus one. It uses square brackets [] with the index value inside to retrieve the \n",
    "desired element. For example, `my_list[2]` will return the third element of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slicing: Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a sequence by specifying a range of indices. It returns a new sequence containing the \n",
    "selected elements. Slicing uses the syntax `start:end:step`, where `start` is the index to start from, `end` is the index to stop before, and \n",
    "`step` is the number of elements to skip between each selected element. The `start` and `step` parameters are optional, and if not provided, \n",
    "they default to the beginning of the sequence and a step of 1, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `my_list[1:4]` will return a new list containing elements from index 1 to 3."
